# Interval-Merge

Program for merging lists of intervals

## Running this program

To run this program either download the source code, import it into your IDE (I used Eclipse) and run the main-class or download the [interval-merge.jar](https://github.com/antolor/interval-merge/raw/master/interval/target/interval-merge.jar) and start it via CLI:

```bash
java -jar interval-merge.jar
```

If you want to build the jar file instead of downloading it, build it via Maven with clean package.
